      <description>Documentation and exhibition of a photography workshop in my 4th semester in cooperation with street photographer Margret Hoppe.
During the 4th semester I got the opportunity to participate in a photography workshhop. The main goal was to show the beauty and diversity of the city of Münchberg. Every student was assigned a grid square of Münchberg randomly. We spent the whole day taking photos in these grid squares. Subsequently, all photography series were talked about and compiled.</description>

      <description>Our main focus during the 4th semester was to work with the city of Münchberg and the people living there. As a part of this project, I created a city map on the subject of the diversity of religion in Münchberg.
I mainly worked with photography and illustration. To show the variety of beliefs, I added interviews with inhabitants of Münchberg. I especialliy wanted to include personal stories and experiences to make my project more relatable and understandable.</description>
