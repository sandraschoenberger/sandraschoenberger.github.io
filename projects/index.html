During my 3rd Semester I concepted, illustrated and produced a book about a single rice grain and the journey it has to go on in order to be sold an consumed in Germany. The illustrations series, which comprises 15 pictures, were realized with linocut. My intention was to lead the reader through simple structures and a guiding concept.
Since India is one of the most important exporters for rice, I decided to let the journey start there, more precisely in the state Tamil Nadu.</div>

We also talked to a neurologist about our app. The design is built very simple to guarantee a fast use without difficulty in case of emergency.</div>
