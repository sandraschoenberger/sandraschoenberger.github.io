      <description>A dictionary about German words with Arabic roots.
This group project was developed during the 2nd semester. Every student picked a word and created an illustration and a poetical text for this word. I picked the word &amp;ldquo;Safran&amp;rdquo;. Since we were not able to meet in person because of the pandemic, we chose the kitchen lithography for our illustrations.</description>

      <description>Conception, Illustration and designing of the app &amp;ldquo;FAST-Test&amp;rdquo;, which is meant to help stroke patients and relatives.
This project was a group project of a fellow student and me. In order to build a functional and working prototype, we spent a lot of time on the conception, which included personas, user stories and user journeys. We also talked to a neurologist about our app. The design is built very simple to guarantee a fast use without difficulty in case of emergency.</description>

      <description>Conception, illustration and production of the book &amp;ldquo;Das Reis(e)korn&amp;rdquo;
During my 3rd Semester I concepted, illustrated and produced a book about a single rice grain and the journey it has to go on in order to be sold an consumed in Germany. The illustrations series, which comprises 15 pictures, were realized with linocut. My intention was to lead the reader through simple structures and a guiding concept.
Since India is one of the most important exporters for rice, I decided to let the journey start there, more precisely in the state Tamil Nadu.</description>
